### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying the design properties of a mockup is essential for ensuring consistency and clarity during development. These properties serve as a blueprint for translating the visual design into code. They help:

- **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure uniform styles across the application.
- **Improve Communication:** Provide developers with clear design specifications.
- **Enhance Usability:** Ensure that design choices, such as color contrasts and typography, meet accessibility standards.
- **Save Time:** Streamline the development process by reducing guesswork and misinterpretation.
